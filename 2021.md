  Project was derived from some other repository, and was taken up by final students. 
  Apart from all the going issues in the repo, i figured some major problems
  - bloated docker image
  - No error handling or fallbacks in code, one error crashes everything, and services were tightly coupled, one error would break everything. 

   The docker image contained both the frontend(react) and server(go), but only exposed port for the server. Also the project used systemd for loging and the base image for docker was based on alpine which doesnt use systemd. After creating a pull request fixing the issue by changing the base image, the maintainer asked to disable logging for the whole project. That would trigger breaking changes to all services depending upon it, plus the project was intended to be a monitoring service, half of it would become useless. Another PR solving the same issue in exact same way was created by another student and was merged, though they didnt solve the dashboard problem.
